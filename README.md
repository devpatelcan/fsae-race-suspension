# FSAE Race Suspension

Formula SAE is an international engineering race competition where students design and build single-seat, high-performance race cars. These vehicles integrate a wide range of advanced systems that work together simultaneously to achieve maximum performance. Among the many systems, I was fascinated by the suspension system, which plays a critical role in the vehicle's handling. To deepen my understanding, I challenged myself to research various suspension systems and how they work. This project allowed me to refine my CAD modeling skills, motion studies, and my understanding of advanced CAD systems.

The image above shows the full assembly of the front suspension in an FSAE vehicle. Its subsystems include the anti-roll bar (dark blue section at the bottom), wheel assembly (green and teal members), bell crank (the purple part), and the dampers. The damper used in this system is the Ohlins TTX25 50mm shock absorber. To lower the center of gravity and maintain the structural rigidity of the suspension, the wishbone (teal member) is attached to the lower control arm.
